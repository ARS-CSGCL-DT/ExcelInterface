8/5/2018 added a file for drip input but am not using it yet
8/14/2018 program started formatting some values as dates. I had to explicitly
format some cells as general. I also made sure all the record sets were closed after running 
a module.
9/10/2018 added columns for residue to the fertilization table. Now output this to the layer file
9/17/2018 removed location string from query in create climate table module. Can probably remove it from
     the spreadsheet. I added a location to the weather table. This way we can choose specific rows from the file.
  ths location in the description table should point to the rows in the weather table
